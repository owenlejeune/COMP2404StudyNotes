# Overloading <a name="overloading"></a>
* same name, different parameter types/ordering
* must have unique *signature*(not unique prototype)
* unique return type insufficient
* should be used for functionality related tasks
* compiler **mangles** every function name
    - changes into combination of name & ordered parameter types
    - makes each function name unique
- compiler chooses which function to call based on how it's called (parameter types and order)

### Operator Overloading <a name="operover"></a>
* define how operators work on user-defined types
    ```c++
        Student matilda, joe;
        if(matilda > joe){
            cout << "Matilda wins!" << endl;
        }else{
            cout << "Joe wins!" << endl;
        }
    ```
* language consistency
* code readability
* implicitly overloaded operators
    - assignment: =
    - address-of: &
    - sequencing: ,
- explicitly overloaded operators
    - class developer decides
    - almost all operators can be overloaded
    - each operator must be overloaded separately
```c++
    //example of overloading > for Student
    bool Student::operator>(Student& s){
        return age > s.age;
    }
```

##### Dynamic Allocation <a name="dynamic"></a>
* for objects with dynamically allocated memory, should provide:
    - copy constructor
    - destructor
    - overloaded assignment operator

### Approach to Overloading <a name="approach"></a>
* operator is keyword (keyword **operator** followed by symbol)
* operands are parameters
* operators can be overloaded as **global** or **member** functions
* **limitations:**
    - cannot change operators on built-in types
    - cannot create new operators
    - cannot change [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity)
    - cannot change precedence or associativity
    - cannot overload non-overloadable operators
        - eg) **dot, scope resolution, conditional**

# Cascading <a name="cascading"></a>
* chaining together member function calls together in single statement
* member function returns the object
* **this**: am objects pointer to itself
    - passed as implicit parameter to each member function (except static functions)
- **this** can be used implicitly or explicitly
- next member function operates on returned object, etc.
```c++
    someObj.someFun().someOtherFunc().nextFunc().moreFunc()
```

# Operators as Functions <a name="opasfunc"></a>
* operators can be overloaded as global or member functions
    - can't overload same operator as both
- member function:
    - left-most operand is target obj (obj member function called on)
        - dereference **this** pointer to access target
    - remaining operand passed in as reference parameter for binary operators
- global function:
    - all operands are parameters
    - must be friend to access private or protected members
- global vs member
    - some operators must be overloaded as member functions:
        - cast: ()
        - subscript: []
        - arrow: ->
    - some operators much be overloaded as global functions:
        - stream insertion/extraction: <</>>
        - other operators: we want to enable commutativity
- always enable cascading where possible

### Stream Operators <a name="stream"></a>
* already overloaded for built in types
* **must** be overloaded as global functions
* stream insertion operator **<<** takes two operands
    - left-hand side operand is **cout** (object of **ostream**), use it as reference
    - right-hand side operand is object to be output
    - must be friend function of class
- stream extraction operator **>>** takes two operands
    - left-hand side operand is **cin** (object of **istream**), use it as reference
    - right-hand side operand is object to be input
    - must be friend function of class
```c++
    class SomeClass{
        friend ostream& operator<<(ostream&, SomeClass&);
        friend ostream& operator>>(ostream&, SomeClass&);
        /* ... */
    }
    /* ... */
    int main(){
        /* ... */
        cout << instanceOfSomeClass;
        cin >> instanceOfSomeClass;
    }
```

### Unary Operators <a name="unary"></a>
* overloaded as global function:
    - one parameter: object/reference to object operated on
- overloaded as member function:
    - no parameters
    - cannot be static
```c++
    //unary - (negation) implemented as member function
    SomeClass& SomeClass::operator-(){/*...*/}
```

### Binary Operators <a name="binary"></a>
* overloaded as global function:
    - two parameters (one must be object/reference to object operated on)
- overloaded as member function:
    - one parameter
    - cannot be static
```c++
    //+ implemented as member function
    SomeClass& SomeClass::operator+(SomeClass&){/*...*/}
```

### Operators on Collection Classes <a name="collections"></a>
* many useful operators:
    - accessing elements: **[]**
    - adding/removing elements **+, -, +=, -=**
    - comparing collections: **==, !=**
    - etc.

### Increment and Decrement <a name="incdec"></a>
* prefix **++** or **--**
    - modifies object
    - returns reference to object
    - overloaded as global function:
        - one parameter: object/reference to object operated on
    - overloaded as member function:
        - no parameters
- distinguish prefix and postfix with dummy parameter
- postfix **++** or **--**
    - makes local copy of object
    - modifies original object
    - returns local copy (**NOT** a reference)
    - need copy constructor
    - creation of temp object makes prefix slower
    - overloaded as global function:
        - two parameters: object/reference to object operated on and dummy int
    - overloaded as member function:
        - one parameter: dummy int

```c++
    //prefix ++ and --
    SomeClass& SomeClass::operator++(){/*...*/}
    SomeClass& SomeClass::operator--(){/*...*/}
    //postfix ++ and --
    SomeClass SomeClass::operator++(int){/*...*/}
    SomeClass SomeClass::operator--(int){/*...*/}
```
