# Polymorphism <a name="polymorphism"></a>
* providing interface at base class level
    - **same** interface to multiple classes in inheritance hierarchy
- allowing generalized use of derived classes
    - client classes do no know the type of derived object
- manipulation of derived objects using base class pointers or references
- enables generalized use of a class hierarchy
    - program for general case, specialize behaviour for specific cases
- allows each class in hierarchy to encapsulate its own behaviour
- adding new classes has no impact on existing classes
- client classes don't need to know the kind of derived object

How does polymorphism work? <a name="howpolywork"></a>
* use base class pointers to manipulate derived class objects
* invoke generalized function, overridden by specialized one
    - each object knows its own specialized behaviour
- correct function on correct class is selected at run time (dynamic binding)

- only works on objects related to each other by inheritance
- only works using pointers to objects, **not the objects themselves**
- derived class object can be treated as base class object (is-a)

# Dynamic Binding <a name="binding"></a>
* handle: identifier used to access an object
    - variable name of object
    - reference to object
    - pointer to object
- invoke derived class behaviour given base class handle
- function binding: linking a function call to the specific function to execute
    - static binding:
        - selection made at compile time
        - always used when classed on object name (dot operator)
        - *can* be used when called on object pointer or reference
    - dynamic binding
        - selection made at **runtime**
        - **never** used when called on object name
        - *can* be used when called on object pointer or reference
- advantage: decision about which function to call made based on object type

### Virtual Functions <a name="virtual"></a>
* function to execute selected at runtime
* selection based on type of **object, not type of handle**
    - base class object == base class function
    - derived class object == derived class function
- *virtual-ness* inherited all the way down the hierarchy

    eg)
- virtual destructors
    - used to deallocate memory using base class pointer
    - calls the correct destructor based on object type
- non-virtual destructors
    - calls destructor based on handle type
    - can result in unpredictable behaviour

# Abstract Classes <a name="abstract"></a>
* class that is too general to have instances
* no objects of class can be created
* typically used as base class to provide generalized interface
* in C++, specified with **pure virtual function**
    - virtual function given **no** implementation
    - guarantees that all concrete classes must override it
    - having >1 pure virtual function makes class abstract
    - all concrete derived classes **must** provide implementation
```c++
    //pure virtual function declaration
    virtual void somefunc() = 0
```

# Dynamic Casting <a name="casting"></a>
* **dynamic_cast** operator used to downcast base class pointer
    - used when access to derived class members needed
    - returns 0 if downcast fails
- safe checking of whether or not object is of specific type
