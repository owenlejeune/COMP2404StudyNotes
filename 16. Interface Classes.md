# Interface Classes <a name="interclass"></a>
* class that encapsulates set of behaviours or algorithms
* allows client class to dynamically change which code executes
* treats behaviours as an object to be swiched at runtime

#### Using Entity Classes <a name="entityclass"></a>
* encapsulating behaviour in entity class

![Entity Class Diagram](Images/entity-class.png)
* traditional solution; promotes data abstraction, encapsulation; uses polymorphism
* problem: changing behaviour at runtime

#### Using an Interface Class <a name="usinginterclass"></a>
* new solution:
    - encapsulate behaviour inside behaviour class
    - entity object delegates responsibility to behaviour object
    - entity object can point to different behaviour objects as needed
- encapsulating behaviour in a behaviour class
![Behaviour Class Diagram](Images/behaviour-class.png)
* advantages:
    - adding new behaviour
        - add new behaviour class, no need to change entity objects
    - reusing behaviours
        - zombies with guns? they can use existing shooting behaviour

    - behaviour can change at runtime
        - term over? zombies can become students again
        ![](Images/ZombieCollege.jpg)
    - still promotes data abstraction, ecapsulation, uses polymorphism

# Strategy Design Pattern <a name="strategy"></a>
* behavioural design pattern
* provides family of algorithms
    - defines abstract interface for family of algorithms
    - encapsulates each type of behaviour(algorithm)
    - concrete implementations are interchangeable at runtime
